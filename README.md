# HPCL--Models-
HPCL Green Energy Expansion Model

Overview

This project is part of HPCL's green energy expansion initiative, focusing on the development and optimization of renewable fuel technologies. The models developed include a Hydrogen Dispensing System, Biofuel Predictor, and a Signal Transmission System. These Python-based models aim to improve the accuracy of fuel predictions, optimize storage, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Key Features

Hydrogen Dispensing System: Simulates and monitors hydrogen dispensing processes to ensure efficient and safe fuel distribution.

Biofuel Predictor: Predicts biofuel production and capacity based on input data, allowing for resource planning and storage optimization.

Data Transmission System: Collects, transmits, and stores telemetry data from sensors to ThingsBoard for real-time monitoring and visualization.

Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language for model development.

ThingsBoard – IoT platform for data visualization and telemetry management.

Flask/Django – Web interface for data input and monitoring (optional).

Pandas/Numpy – Data processing and predictive analytics.

Matplotlib/Seaborn – Data visualization and reporting.
